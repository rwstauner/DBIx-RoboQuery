  [Backward Incompatible Bugfix]
  - Fixed internal template processing which previously ignored errors
    processing 'preference' templates.
    This was considered a bug as exceptions would silently cause preference
    to essentially be ignored (and always choose the last record).
    NOTE: this could cause errors to be thrown in the resultset stage
    if the templates passed to "prefer()" don't compile.
