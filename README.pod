=head1 DBIx::RoboQuery

This robotic query object can be configured to help you
get exactly the result set that you want.

It was designed to run in a completely automated (unmanned) environment and
read in a template that both builds the desired SQL query dynamically
and configures the query output.
It should be usable anywhere you desire
a highly configurable query and result set.

See POD for more information.
